# RAPI Library / python

This is the official repository of the Reactioon API communication library for the python language.

## Focus

This library must meet some requirements, see the list below:

1. Simple and easy to use.
2. Easy to maintain/upgrade.
3. Reusable

## Usage

import rapi

api_key = "public key"

secret_key = "secret key"

rapi.keys(api_key,secret_key)

rapi.request(method,path,data)

exemple in test.py

## Considerations
This library is under development and may change over time. The integrity of existing methods will be maintained to avoid compatibility issues in the future.

## Contributions
